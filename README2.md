# Project Portfolio

My online portfolio built using HTML and CSS, with layout setup using Bulma CSS framework. This is based on the first iteration of the portfolio design, developed in Week 3 of the course. The online portfolio is mobile-responsive, and showcases two homework assignments - the code quiz app and the password generator app, as well as my first group project assignment - a recipe app "Chop 'n' Change". It also provides screenshots, links to the deployed pages and their respective Github repos. 

The portfolio provides links to my email address, Github repo, and my LinkedIn profile as well as a downloadable resume.
